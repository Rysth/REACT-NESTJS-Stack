# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive authentication system for the NestJS application using Passport.js. The system will provide secure user authentication using username/password credentials and JWT tokens for API access, following industry best practices for RESTful API authentication.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The complete Passport-based authentication implementation
- **Local_Strategy**: Passport strategy for username/password authentication
- **JWT_Strategy**: Passport strategy for JSON Web Token validation
- **Auth_Guard**: NestJS guard that protects routes using Passport strategies
- **User_Service**: Service responsible for user data management and retrieval
- **Auth_Service**: Service handling authentication logic and JWT operations
- **Protected_Route**: API endpoint that requires valid JWT authentication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to authenticate users with username and password credentials, so that I can obtain a JWT token for subsequent API requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends valid username and password to the login endpoint, THE Authentication_System SHALL return a JWT access token
2. WHEN a client sends invalid credentials to the login endpoint, THE Authentication_System SHALL return an unauthorized error response
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL validate user credentials against the user database
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL generate JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL include user identification information in the JWT payload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to access protected endpoints using JWT tokens, so that I can perform authenticated operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client includes a valid JWT bearer token in the authorization header, THE Authentication_System SHALL grant access to protected routes
2. WHEN a client provides an invalid or expired JWT token, THE Authentication_System SHALL deny access and return an unauthorized error
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL extract user information from valid JWT tokens and make it available to route handlers
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL automatically validate JWT signatures and expiration times
5. WHERE a route is marked as protected, THE Authentication_System SHALL require valid JWT authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be modular and maintainable, so that I can easily extend or modify authentication strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL implement separate modules for authentication, user management, and strategy configuration
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL use dependency injection for service integration
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide reusable guard classes for different authentication strategies
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL separate authentication logic from business logic
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL follow NestJS architectural patterns and best practices
